Zumba - Clone

This project is a clone of the Zumba website, created solely with HTML and CSS. It aims to replicate the layout and design elements of the original site while serving as a practice exercise for honing HTML and CSS skills.

Please note that as part of my learning process, this project may not adhere strictly to best practices or industry standards. However, it reflects my progress and dedication to mastering HTML and CSS fundamentals.

Throughout this endeavor, I have gained valuable insights into structuring web pages, styling elements, and implementing responsive design principles. Despite any imperfections, this project represents a significant milestone in my journey towards becoming proficient in web development.

I appreciate your understanding and welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement as I continue to refine my skills and knowledge in HTML and CSS.
